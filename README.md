Sephora’s digital marketplace contains thousands of products spanning dozens of brands and categories. Traditional performance metrics—such as star ratings or raw review counts—are too uniform or inconsistent to meaningfully distinguish top performers.
This project provides a scalable analytical framework for identifying:
High-demand products
Strong and weak categories
Consistently outperforming brands
Hidden high-quality products with low visibility
Price-contextualized extreme popularity outliers
The analysis integrates review metadata, product engagement metrics, pricing, and robust statistical techniques to derive strategic insights relevant for assortment planning, merchandising, and brand evaluation.
